🏠 Home Loan Data Analysis & Prediction
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a Home Loan dataset to understand the factors influencing loan approvals and rejections. Using Python, the project applies data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to uncover key patterns. Additionally, machine learning models are implemented to predict the likelihood of loan approval based on applicant details.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset for accurate analysis.

Perform EDA to identify patterns in demographics, income, and loan approvals.

Visualize insights through graphs and charts.

Build predictive models to classify loan approval status.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning (classification models)

Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

📊 Key Insights

Married applicants with higher income show higher approval chances.

Graduate applicants and self-employed individuals influence approval rates differently.

Loan amount and loan term strongly affect approval decisions.

Gender, dependents, and property area also play a significant role in eligibility.
